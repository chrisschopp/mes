# mes
A discrete event simulation that produces data similar to that created by a Manufacturing Execution System (MES), from which analysis of factory performance can be done.

The .ipynb shows the output of the simulation, as one would find in a database populated by the MES.

An interactive [Streamlit app](https://factory-simulation.herokuapp.com/) is currently under development.

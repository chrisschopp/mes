# Factory Simulation

This interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web app uses the discrete event simulation framework [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The output of this simulation is similar to that produced by a [Manufacturing Execution System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_execution_system) (MES).

An MES is foundational to smart manufacturing, allowing Industry 4.0 practitioners to monitor factory performance in real-time. Effective use of this data can reduce costs and improve performance to customer demand.

Analysis of factory performance can be done with the MES-like data produced by this simulation, much as would be done with data produced by real factory automation.
